This was a group project with 4 other participants, stored on a GitLab repository. While I would love to have imported straight from the Gitlab, I was not able to push the contents due to it requireing large files for the Computer Vision models. I tried excluding the files and even using gits LFS to put links to the large files in this repository, but nothing has worked. 

For this repository I just moved the code from my local machine, not including the large files required to run it. My main contribution to the project involved boundingboxes.py, modelloadpipeline.py and inference_keras.py. Hopefully I can figure out how to get everything on this GitHub page, commits included.
